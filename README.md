You are a Python beginner who is interested in learning Python and using Python to develop machine learning models in less than 3 hours.

You are interested in using free and powerful cloud CPU and GPU computers to develop and run your Python codes.

Almost wherever you are in the world, Google will give you free remote access to its computers.

Free CPU, GPU, and TPU processors to develop and run your Python codes for Free!

You only need to have Gmail (free) and Google Chrome (also free) installed on your operating system!

It does not matter what your operating system is.

No bulky software is required, just Google Chrome web browser!

Almost all the cheapest computers in the market can handle Google Chrome, so no significant computer system is required.

You have no or little knowledge of Python, are interested in learning Python and want to practice machine learning problems in Python, all in a matter of fewer than 3 hours.

You might have no or little knowledge of Python; you will be taught!

You might have no or little knowledge of machine learning or neural networks; you will be taught, and you will practice them in Python!

You are so busy and don't have the time to go over a 25-hour course that teaches you many rudimentary programming basics.

You need optimum materials in a minimum amount of time to help you drive Python by yourself!

You prefer not even install any additional complicated software, editors, or programs on your computer to run Python!

You might have an old rusty computer, but it is able to run the latest version of Google Chrome (i.e., the Google free web browser).

Your computer has limited memory to run programming scripts or has a limited hard drive to install bulky and complicated software.

You will benefit the most if you are familiar with at least one computation-based programming language, such as MATLAB, R, C, C++, C#, etc., and want to switch to or learn Python.

We are not going to explain, say, what a "for-loop" is, but we will see how to create, say, "for-loops" in Python.

We are not explaining what an array or matrix is.
